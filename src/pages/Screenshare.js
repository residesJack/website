						<p>
							In an effort to combat cheating, Warzone is utilising
							'screensharing.' Screensharing is the process of scanning and
							searching through a suspected cheater's computer in order to
							detect client modifications that violate Warzone's rules.
						</p>

						<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
						Player privacy is prioritised during a screenshare. Staff members
						conducting screenshares will not look for any information that does
						not pertain to cheat detection. That being said, Warzone does not
						guarantee sensitive information will not be encountered in the
						screenshare process. Players are expected to make sure that
						sensitive information is not stored in any folders that are related
						to Minecraft or similar. In the event that sensitive information is
						discovered, it will be kept private within the screenshare & senior
						staff.
						<br />
						<br />
						If a player requires any clarification about programs or methods
						during a screenshare, the screenshare will be paused and questions
						will be answered. Players may request to pause or stop the
						screenshare at any time.
						<br />
						<br />
						Note that all screenshares are recorded to be reviewed by senior
						staff members for quality assurance and to be referenced in the
						event of an abuse report.
						<br />
						<br />
						<span className='bold'>
							If you feel like your privacy has been violated in a Warzone
							screenshare, or have any complaints about a screenshare, please
							contact a senior staff member immediately.

						<h2>Process</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								A suspicious player will be asked to submit to a screenshare by
								a Warzone staff member
							</li>
							<li>
								The player will join a public voice channel in the Warzone
								Discord server, to be moved into a private voice channel with
								staff
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the player and screenshare staff are in the voice channel,
								the player will be asked to share their entire screen on Discord
							</li>
							<li>
								The player will be asked to install AnyDesk, a program that
								provides remote desktop access to the staff member performing
								the screenshare
							</li>
							<li>
								During the screenshare, the screenshare staff may install
								trusted programs listed on this page that aid in the cheat
								detection process
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the Warzone staff members have come to a conclusion, the
								screenshare will end, and further information will be given by
								the screenshare staff
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
